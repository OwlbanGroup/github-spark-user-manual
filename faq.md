### Why "Spark"?

Because it can serve as the spark of curiosity for your software-based ideas. But also, because it just sounds cool ðŸ˜Ž

### Is it "Spark" or "spark"?

The service/tool is called "GitHub Spark". But the apps you create with it are called "sparks" (e.g. "Hey did you check out that spark that I shared with you?").

### What is the GitHub Spark design system built on?

The built-in components in GitHub Spark are built upon React and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com), and our design system is built around [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). We love all of these projects, and are grateful to be able to leverage their amazing work ðŸ’™
