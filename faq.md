# ℹ️ Frequently asked questions

Hello! This FAQ is living document, which tries to capture any and all of the interesting questions that folks might have about GitHub Spark. If you don't see something below, then feel free to open an issue on this repom and we can respond with a PR to fix it 🫡

## Why "Spark"?

Because it can serve as the **spark** of inspiration/curiosity for your software-based ideas. But also, because it just sounds cool 😎

## Is it "Spark" or "spark"?

The service/tool is called "GitHub Spark". But the apps you create with it are called "sparks" (e.g. "Hey did you check out that spark that I shared with you?"). And again, "sparks" just sounds cool 😎

## Which models does GitHub Spark support?

Currently, it allows you to choose between Claude Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and o1-mini. However, we'll be constantly evaluating new models, in order to ensure that GitHub Spark provides users with access to the latest/best AI.

## What is the GitHub Spark design system built on?

The built-in components in GitHub Spark are built upon React and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com), and our design system is built around [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). We love all of these projects, and are grateful to be able to leverage their amazing work 💙
