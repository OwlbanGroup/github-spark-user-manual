# 🏃 Getting started

Once you've been admitted off the GitHub Spark waitlist (you'll get an e-mail), getting started is simple!

1. Open your browser and navigate to https://spark.githubnext.com

1. Sign in with the same GitHub account that you registered with on the waitlist

1. From the dashboard page, enter a request for an app idea (e.g. `a tic tac toe game`, and then press `<ENTER>`

After a few moments--and a pretty loading screen experience--you should see your shiny new spark ✨

From here, you can continue to iterate on your spark, by specifying new revisions via the `Iterate` tab in the action bar at the bottom. Additionally, you can select different models, and try generating variants, in order to explore other options/directions for a revision 👍

## Other fun things to try...

1. Hover over the history timeline on the left, and navigate through your revisions
2. Make an app that stores data, and ask GitHub Spark to save/load it. Then check out the `Data` tab in the action bar 🚀
3. Ask GitHub Spark to use AI to perform some sort of generative AI task (e.g. summarizing or generate content). Then check out the `Prompts` tab in the action bar 🤖
4. Install the GitHub Spark dashboard as a PWA on your desktop or phone, so you can easily create and access your sparks
